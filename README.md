# Intro

Meeting Buddy is an app to help manage team meetings. It allows you to manage the time limits for each speaker, take notes as each speaker is talking, managed the order in which people are picked to speak to avoid asking for candidates and keep things spontaneous.

## Background

Having been involved in a recent discusion about how to pick who speaks and when during a meeting I started toying with the idea for this app. It should remove all the pain from running and managing a team meeting other than the initial setup. Completely cloud based with the ability to review previous meetings agendas / minutes.
